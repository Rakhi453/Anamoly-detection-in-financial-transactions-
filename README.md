# Anamoly-detection-in-financial-transactions

This repository contains a project focused on developing and implementing anomaly detection algorithms to identify irregular patterns in financial transactions. The primary objective is to mitigate potential fraud risks and enhance the security and integrity of financial systems.

Financial transactions are prone to various types of fraudulent activities, which can lead to significant financial losses. This project aims to develop robust anomaly detection methods to identify and flag suspicious transactions. By leveraging machine learning and statistical techniques, the project seeks to enhance the detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

We have Utilized the #Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection and #t-SNE for data visualization.
